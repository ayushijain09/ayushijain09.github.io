Iâ€™m a Senior Data Scientist focused on using machine learning and AI to solve real-world problems. My work spans everything from anomaly detection to NLP, with a strong emphasis on building scalable, data-driven solutions.

I thrive on turning complex data into actionable insights. Passionate about the future of data science, I actively mentor emerging talent, helping them navigate the field and develop their skills.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
