During the time that I worked with her, she rose to accept challenges and solve problems that were new to her. Not only she did solve them, but also suggested ideas of what can be done to improve upon them. She is not afraid to learn new things, and works extra hard to excel at them. Would love to work with you again. Kudos!"
